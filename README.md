🎓 Predicting Parental Education Level from Student Performance
🧩 Problem Statement

The goal of this project is to predict the parental level of education using student-related features such as gender, lunch type, test preparation course, and exam scores (math, reading, and writing).

⚙️ Process

- Data Cleaning: Handled outliers and missing values.

- Encoding: Converted categorical data to numeric form.

- Splitting: Divided data into training and testing sets.

- Model Training: Applied Logistic Regression for prediction.

- Evaluation: Calculated accuracy and classification metrics.

- Visualization: Displayed confusion matrix for performance check.

📊 Result

Model Accuracy: ~25%

Insight: Student performance and demographics do not strongly predict parental education level.
